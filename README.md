# angular1.5-weather-forecast

Simple single page application with Angular 1.5.3 that shows a 7-day forecast for a city by name.

REST API: http://openweathermap.org/api.

User is able to query by city name.

Features:

- JSONP to perform a cross domain AJAX request
- Displays the forecast in a chart
- Uses LocalStorage because the API will give an HTTP Error if user makes too many requests in a short period of time.


Things to improve: 
- current detailed weather module
- query by number of days
- tabs: table, chart
- routes
- unit tests
